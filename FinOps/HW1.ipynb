    "The purpose of this problem is to make a statistical out-of-sample analysis of the optimal solution of the Stock/Bond/Call portfolio investment problem considered in class. For that purpose, it is ok to use any software tool you see fit (i.e., EXCEL, Matlab, Python, etc.). Let $s_k$ for $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ be the value of the stock in the future in scenario $k$ (i.e., $s_1=40$, $s_2=20$, $s_3=12$). Now, add uncertainty to scenario values as follows $s^j_k=s_k+\\epsilon^j_k$ where $\\epsilon^j_k\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$ for $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $j\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,M\\}$ where $M$ is the number of sample used in the out-of-sample analysis (use a value of $M$ larger than or equal to $30$ to get statistically significant results), and $X\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0,\\sigma)$ is a normal random variable with mean zero and standard deviation $\\sigma$.  \n",

Using these values, plot a histogram showing the distribution of the out-of-sample net profit of the optimal portfolio, compute its expected out-of-sample net profit and associated standard deviation.\n",

Your portfolio should not sell call options; that is, your portfolio should only invest the budget in buying stocks, bonds, and call options. For example your portfolio might be obtained by investing 70% of the budget in stocks and $30\\%$ of the budget in bonds, or you might use $33\\%$ of the money for each stocks, bonds, and calls. Choose a portfolio and briefly (a couple sentences justify your choice). Then, perform the same out-of-sample performance experiment you did for the optimal portfolio $S^∗ = 3500$, $B^∗ = 0$, $C_+^∗ =0$, $C_−^∗ = 5000$ (it is better if you use the same values $\\epsilon^j_k\\sim\\mathcal{N}(0, \\sigma)$, for $k\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$ and $j\\in\\{1,2,\\dots,M\\}$ for both experiments).

To finish, we want to know if any difference in the expected net profit of the two portfolios considered is statistically significant. For this purpose, call $\\mu^*$ the expected net profit of the optimal portfolio, and $\\mu^0$ the expected net profit of the rule-of-thumb portfolio. Now (using the software of your choice, or by hand) perform a difference of population means between the expected net profit of both portfolios at a significance level of $\\alpha = 0.05$ to accept or reject the Null Hypothesis \n",
