Given the model above, the measure $\\mathrm{P}$ is already the risk-neautral measure (because both stocks have rate of return $r$).  We write $\\sigma_2^2=\\sigma_{2,1}^2+\\sigma_{2,2}^2$.  We consider a *swap* option, which gives you the right, at time $T$, to exchange one share of $X$ for one share of $Y$.  That is, the option has the payoff\n",

Indeed $\\frac{X_T}{x_0}$ has exactly the form given in the formula for the Radon-Nykodim derivative for an appropriate choice of the drift process $\\gamma_t$.  The consequence is that\n",
